# Xpress-Hirely
 Online Vehicle Renting System using MERN stack

Company Background 

 

We are currently developing a product for a client of Pruthivi Developers Lanka which is a vehicle renting company. The client is the owner of the company. The parent company is located overseas, and the client established a subsidiary branch in Sri Lanka in 2008. It was registered in 2012 and has a successful history of 12 years to date. Despite being in business for a long time, we have identified the company had not established an online presence which could have led to missed opportunities for growth and expansion. We are designing this product exclusively for the Sri Lankan branch. 

The client, who owns the company, provides a collection of personally owned vehicles for customer's rental purposes. The vehicle rental system provides a car catalogue for the customers to select a car of their preference. For renting purposes company allows the customers to rent based on two variable factors: mileage and daily basis. Customers will pay an additional charge for exceeding the mileage limit or for the delay in returning the vehicle.  

 

Our web application 

 

A web-based vehicle rental management solution named Xpress Hirely is developed to provide a convenient and timely rental service. This web application can be utilized for wedding cars, casual trips, business trips, tourists and for customers who have temporary vehicle needs. 

To access our Xpress Hirely website, users are required to register with their email. Once registered, users can easily select their preferred vehicle based on their preferences. We have made the registration process simpler and more efficient by offering Google authentication, which enables users to register quickly and easily using their Google username and password. With this feature, users are immediately registered on our website as soon as they submit their Google credentials. 

The vehicles are maintained to high standards to ensure a safe and comfortable driving experience for the renters. To ensure the timely maintenance of vehicles, we will implement an automated service that tracks whether a vehicle has been serviced and maintained after it has travelled the relevant number of miles since its last service. 

After conducting a thorough analysis, we have discovered that the current business lacks a customer support service. As a result, we have made the decision to incorporate a chat bot that will connect customers with an agent in real-time to assist them in resolving any issues they may be experiencing. 

Our application has been designed to provide users with a hassle-free and convenient car rental experience. We believe that our platform will greatly benefit our users by making the process of renting a car seamless and effortless.
